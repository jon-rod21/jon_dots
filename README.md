# My Hyprland Dot Files :D

I recently downloaded arch on my laptop and wanted to customize it a bit. I took heavy inspiration from r/unixporn.
I have a script that automatically changes my colors whenever my wallpaper changes and its pretty crusty. It just rewrites the config files every time I make a change instead of changing purely the colors, but it works!
I'll definitely change it up in the future but for now this works great.
